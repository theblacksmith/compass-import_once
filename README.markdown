# Compass Import Once Plugin

This gem makes [Sass Import Once][sass-import_once] work with compass.

Sass import_once changes the behaviour of the sass @import directive making never require the same file twice.

It's awesome! [Check it out][sass-import_once]

## Installation

    $ gem install compass-import_once

## Configuration

Add the following to your compass configuration:

    require 'compass-import_once'

## Stylesheet Syntax

The same as always :)
